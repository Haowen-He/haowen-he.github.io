<b>I'm a graduate student of [Applied Mathematics](https://science.rpi.edu/mathematical-sciences) at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu), where I am advised by [Dr. Harry McLaughlin](https://science.rpi.edu/mathematical-sciences/faculty/harry-mclaughlin) and [Dr. Elizabeth Kam](https://science.rpi.edu/mathematical-sciences/faculty/elizabeth-kam). Currently, I'm a research assistant at the [Institute for Data Exploration and Applications](https://idea.rpi.edu), affiliated with the [Darrin Fresh Water Institute](https://dfwi.rpi.edu) and the [Jefferson Project at Lake George](https://jeffersonproject.rpi.edu).</b> 

<b>My current research interests are in </b><b><font color='#16B1B5'>data-driven modeling in mathematical biology</font></b> <b>and</b> <b><font color='#16B1B5'>data science applications</font></b>. <b>My work pursues developing mathematical and computational approaches to study biological phenomena and systems.</b>

<h2>Watershed Forest Studies: Tree Crown Segmentation from Airborne LiDAR Point Clouds</h2>

<img src="https://haowen-he.github.io/images/4th.gif" width="36%" align="right" /> The correct segmentation of individual trees in the forest is necessary for extracting additional information about trees, such as the type of tree and other tree parameters. This project will support tree species identification in the Lake George watershed as part of an ongoing project to locate and study the impact of Hemlock Woolley Adelgid, an invasive species, on trees around the lake. 

<img src="https://haowen-he.github.io/images/Screen Shot 2022-04-25 at 4.20.15 AM.png" width="36%" align="right" /> My work in this realm has been adapting machine learning tools to improve the performance of tree top detection and crown outlining algorithms in challenging forest conditions: mixedwood stands with vertically complex crown structures.<br>

<p><img src="https://haowen-he.github.io/images/filenamehere.gif?raw=true" alt="" width="32%" align="left" /> CyanoHABs are common photosynthetic bacteria that live in surface waters. While we know of many factors that may contribute to CyanoHABs, how these factors come together to create a bloom of algae is not well understood. <br> <br> I'm interested in modeling factors that contribute to CyanoHABs using statistics & data science techniques.</p><br>

<h2>Health INCITE: COVID-19 Contact Tracing and Campus Network Mapping</h2>

<img src="https://haowen-he.github.io/images/Screen Shot 2021-07-14 at 3.39.21 AM.png?raw=true" width="36%" align="right" /> RPI [StudySafe](https://inciteprojects.idea.rpi.edu/studysafe/app/studysafe) is designed to present WAP data to on-campus users so they can make informed decisions on where to go for extended periods of time on campus. The data can be interacted with in several ways, including selecting certain dates, times, locations, as well as through interactive geographical maps.<br>

<h2>Player Tracking and Identification in Ice Hockey</h2>

<img src="https://haowen-he.github.io/images/ezgif-2-ae39a85f44.gif" width="36%" align="right" /> Video frames from on-ice action are analyzed in a time sequential manner to track the motion of players during a short to medium duration of action. Individual player silhouettes are identified and isolated for further analysis. Multi-player combined silhouettes are decomposed to isolate individual players in the group and thus track players into and out of close contact situations. Ensemble of player tracks will be formed into a multi-channel time series for further exploration.<br>
