## Descriptions
* Assessed the effects of surface water temperature, droughts, which caused extremes in reservoir elevation, and chlorophyll on cyanobacterial abundance respectively via Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation, time series and cluster analysis
* Proposed and analyzed mathematical models describing the population dynamics of harmful algae and toxin production and decay under ecological eutrophication, and studied the bifurcation behaviors and stability of the model
* Forecasted and mapped onsets of cyanobacterial blooms via a nonparametric machine learning approach, using a gradient boosted regression tree model
* Investigated the relationship between the warming of surface waters and the stratification, and explored its impact on cyanoHAB events as cyanobacteria may encounter less competition for nutrients under stratified conditions
* Visualized the characteristics of cyanoHABs and the relationship between predictor variables and cyanobacterial abundance using JMP and R
