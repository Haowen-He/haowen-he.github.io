## Descriptions
Video frames from on-ice action will be analyzed in a time sequential manner to track the motion of players during a short to medium duration of action. Individual player silhouettes will be identified and isolated for further analysis. Multi-player combined silhouettes will be decomposed to isolate the individual players in the group and thus track players into and out of close contact situations. The ensemble of player tracks will be formed into a multi-channel time series for further exploration and analysis. The ultimate goal is to identify and classify patterns of action among the players. This has the potential to lead to quantitative, dynamic evaluations of the action and provide additional tools to the coaching staff for tactics and strategy.
