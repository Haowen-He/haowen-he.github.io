## Descriptions  
* Worked as an undergraduate research assistant to build an <b>[app](https://inciteprojects.idea.rpi.edu/apps/safecampus/)</b> that reveals the anonymous usage of Wi-Fi access points and aggregations of wireless users on the campus network at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
* Developed quantitative approaches that help college administrators simulate campus re-open plans and predict future conditions, including campus de- densification, campus network mapping, and selected social distancing models
* Built an interactive geographic dashboard to present analysis and visualizations of WAP data to users so they can make informed decisions on where to go for extended periods of time on campus during the COVID-19 pandemic
